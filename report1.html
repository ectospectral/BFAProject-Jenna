                <p>A family home in Lakewood burned suddenly and intensely late last night, leaving the youngest son still missing. Authorities say it was a miracle that the fire didn't spread to surrounding structures. "I've never seen anything like it," one Deputy, first on the scene, said. "It was gone in minutes, almost like an explosion or something!"</p>
                <p>Authorities are still trying to locate the missing boy. The cause of the fire remains under investigation, with local fire departments working with the state fire marshal's office to determine whether foul play was involved. Neighbors were left shaken by the rapid spread of the blaze, which consumed the home within minutes.</p>
                <p>Local officials have assured residents that the fire posed no further threat to nearby homes. "We got lucky that the fire didn't spread," said Deputy Smith. "It was incredibly fast and contained, thanks to the quick response of the fire crews." Firefighters worked tirelessly throughout the night to ensure the fire did not spread to other properties in the area.</p>
                <p>Authorities are expected to release more information as the investigation progresses, and a community vigil is being planned in honor of the missing boy.</p>
