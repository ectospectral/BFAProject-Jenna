                <p>A family home in Lakewood seemingly disappeared overnight, at least according to neighbors. No record of a house on the empty lot exists, it was likely never developed for whatever reason.</p> 
                    <p>But locals insist a house used to be there. "It was big, like two stories!" One man noted. "There was a kid who lived there, and some other people, I think? It's hard to remember."</p>
                    <p>We'll bring you more on the story as it develops.</p>
